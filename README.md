# SpotFoxx
An Android App that allows the user to link Spotify Musik Songs and Playlists with real world Locations. 
The app can be found in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotfoxx&gl=DE)


# General Idea and Motivation behind the Project
The motivation to work on this app originates from my wish to learn and better understand, how to develop apps. A additional requirement was to better understand the use of APIs (client side only). 
Therefore, I started to search for a well documented and interresting API and found the [Web and Remote API of Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
